### **Part 2: N8N Setup** üîó

Now, use the credentials you just obtained to set up the connection in N8N.

1.  **Add YouTube Node**: In your N8N workflow, add a YouTube node from the list of integrations.
2.  **Create New Credential**: Click on the credential field in the node and select **"New Credential."**
3.  **Enter Credentials**: A new window will appear.
    - In the **OAuth2 Grant Type** dropdown, select **"Authorization Code."**
    - Paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the corresponding fields.
    - Click **"Connect"**.

Your YouTube credentials are now successfully configured in N8N.

This is a common security message from Google that means the app you're trying to connect isn't publicly verified by them. Don't worry, you don't need to publish your app to fix it. You just need to tell Google that you trust this specific app by adding your email to a list of "test users."
