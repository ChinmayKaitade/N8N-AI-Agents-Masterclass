## 🚀 Workflow Pipeline Overview

The automation process is a simple yet powerful sequence of steps:

1.  **📥 Trigger & Input:** The workflow is initiated by a trigger, such as a form submission, which collects the user's input image and other key details (e.g., gender, desired background).
2.  **⚙️ Configuration Setup:** The input data is used to dynamically prepare a prompt and parameters for the AI, defining elements like background style, gender, and other headshot rules.
3.  **🖼️ AI Image Generation:** An API call sends the prepared data to the **Flux Kontext** AI, which processes the request and generates a new, professional headshot image.
4.  **💾 Deliver & Store:** The generated headshot is saved to a designated cloud storage. A notification (e.g., an email) is then sent to the user with their new headshot.
