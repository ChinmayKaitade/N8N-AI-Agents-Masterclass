3.  **Performance Issues:** The app is very slow to load, and there's a noticeable lag when navigating between different sections.
4.  **Lack of Support:** I tried to report the crash, but there's no clear way to contact customer support or submit a bug report within the app.
5.  **Inconsistent Experience:** The app works well on my phone but has major issues on my tablet, leading to a frustrating and inconsistent user experience.

### **Feature Request: Ideas for the Future** üí°

1.  **Dark Mode:** A dark mode option would be great, especially for using the app at night, as it would be easier on my eyes.

3.  **Push Notifications:** I would like to receive push notifications for important updates or messages within the app.
4.  **User-Generated Content:** Allow users to create and share their own templates or designs, which would greatly expand the app's functionality.
5.  **Integration with Other Apps:** The ability to connect with popular tools like Google Drive or Slack would make the workflow much more efficient.
