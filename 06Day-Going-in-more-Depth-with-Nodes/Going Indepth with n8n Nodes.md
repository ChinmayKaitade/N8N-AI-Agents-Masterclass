# **üöÄ Day 06: Deep Dive into n8n - Data Transformation & App Integrations** üìäüßπ

Today's learning was all about getting hands-on with data! I went beyond the basics to learn how to clean, filter, and manage data within n8n workflows, and how to connect it to powerful tools like Google Sheets and Airtable.

## **üí° Core Concepts I Explored**

- **Edit Fields Node**: This node is a powerful tool for tidying up your data. You can use it to select exactly which fields you want to use, rename them for clarity, or even create new fields. It's the first step to ensuring your data is clean and organized for the rest of your workflow.
- **IF Node**: This is your workflow's decision-maker! The IF node allows you to create conditional logic, meaning your workflow can take different paths based on specific criteria. For example, you can filter customer data based on a certain country, ensuring you only process the information you need.
- **Google Sheets Node**: I learned how to seamlessly connect n8n to Google Sheets. This integration is perfect for automating tasks like adding new rows, updating existing data, or reading information directly from your spreadsheet to use in other parts of your workflow. It's a fundamental tool for managing data for tasks like targeted marketing.
- **Airtable Node**: Airtable is a powerful spreadsheet-database hybrid, and n8n's integration makes it even better. I learned how to automatically create, read, update, and delete records. With Airtable, you can manage complex data with ease, making it a great alternative to traditional spreadsheets for more dynamic projects.

## **‚ú® Putting It All Together: A Simple Workflow**

The key takeaway is that by combining these nodes, you can build incredibly useful automations. For instance, a workflow could:

1.  **Read** data from a Google Sheet.
2.  **Filter** that data using an `IF` node to find customers from a specific country.
3.  **Clean** the remaining data with the `Edit Fields` node to get just their name and email.
4.  **Send** this new, clean data to another app for a targeted campaign.

This simple workflow demonstrates how n8n turns complex data handling into a straightforward, visual process.
