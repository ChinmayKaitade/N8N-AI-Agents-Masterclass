# **1. Getting Your Tools Ready (Prerequisites)** üõ†Ô∏è

First, you'll need the following credentials and accounts:

- **Google AI Studio API Key**: You can get this for free from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). This key will be used for both text embedding and generation.
- **Pinecone API Key and Environment**: Sign up for a free account on [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/start) to get your API key and environment URL.
- **Pinecone Index**: Create an index in your Pinecone dashboard with these crucial configurations:
  - **Dimension**: **768**
  - **Metric**: **Cosine**

### **2. The Ingestion Pipeline (Data to Vectors)** üìù‚û°Ô∏èüî¢

This is where you process your raw data and store it in Pinecone.

1.  **Prepare Your Knowledge Base**: Collect all your personal documents, notes, or files (e.g., PDFs, text files) into a centralized location. This is your "knowledge base."
2.  **Convert Data to Vectors**: Use the Gemini `text-embedding-004` model to convert your text data into **dense vectors**. This model excels at capturing the semantic meaning of your content.
3.  **Upload to Pinecone**: Use the Pinecone API to upload (or "upsert") these vectors into your index. Each vector should have a unique ID and can be associated with metadata, such as the original text, to make retrieval easier.

**Manual Configuration Details:**

- **Vector Type**: **Dense**, as each vector is a fixed-length array of floating-point numbers.
- **Dimension**: **768**, to match Gemini's embedding model output.
- **Metric**: **Cosine**, to measure the semantic similarity between vectors.

### **3. The Retrieval Pipeline (Query to Answer)** üí¨‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ

This is the live part of the RAG agent where it answers user questions.

1.  **Get a Query Embedding**: When a user asks a question, use the **same Gemini embedding model** (`text-embedding-004`) to convert their query into a vector. This ensures the query vector is in the same semantic space as your knowledge base vectors.
2.  **Perform a Vector Search**: Send the user's query vector to your Pinecone index. The Pinecone service will perform a similarity search to find the top `k` most relevant document vectors in your index.
3.  **Augment the Prompt**: Pinecone will return the original text associated with the most relevant vectors. You will then combine this retrieved text with the user's original question to create an "augmented prompt."
4.  **Generate the Final Answer**: Send the augmented prompt to a powerful Gemini large language model (LLM), such as `gemini-pro`. The LLM will use the provided context to generate a precise, accurate, and human-readable answer.

This final process ensures the chatbot doesn't just rely on its general training data; instead, it uses your specific, personal information to provide a truly personalized and relevant response.
