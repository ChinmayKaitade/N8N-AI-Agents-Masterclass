# **Building an n8n Workflow: A Simple Guide** üöÄ

Building a workflow in n8n is like creating a step-by-step instruction manual for a robot. You define a starting point, give it tasks to complete, and tell it how to make decisions along the way.

## **1. The Starting Point: Trigger Nodes** üîî

Every workflow begins with a **Trigger Node**. This is the event that tells your workflow when to start running. Without a trigger, the workflow stays inactive.

- A **Form Submission Trigger** starts a workflow whenever someone fills out a form you've created.
- A **Schedule Trigger** can start a workflow at a specific time, like every morning at 9 AM.
- A **Webhook Trigger** listens for data from another application, starting the workflow as soon as it receives information.

## **2. Making Decisions: Utility Nodes** üßÆ

After a workflow is triggered, **Utility Nodes** help you manipulate data and control the flow of the process. They are the "brains" of your workflow, adding a layer of logic.

- The **Switch Node** is used to create different paths in your workflow based on a condition. For example, you can tell the workflow to follow one path if a form submission lists "Video Editor" as a profession and a different path if it's a "Graphic Designer."
- The **Set Node** allows you to add or modify data that will be used later in the workflow.
- The **Function Node** gives you the power to write custom code for more complex data manipulation.

## **3. Performing Actions: App Nodes** ü§ù

These nodes connect to thousands of different apps and services. They allow your workflow to perform specific tasks, like sending an email, creating a social media post, or updating a database.

- The **Airtable Node** is a great example. You can use it to create or update records in an Airtable database with information collected from your workflow.

## **4. The Intelligence: AI Agent Nodes** üß†

This is where your workflow becomes truly smart. **AI Agent Nodes** allow you to integrate a large language model (LLM) to make complex decisions or generate creative content.

- You can configure an AI agent to read details from a form submission and generate unique content, like a poem or a summary, which can then be added to an Airtable record.
- These agents can be given instructions on what to create and how to behave, adding a layer of intelligence and personalization to your automation.
