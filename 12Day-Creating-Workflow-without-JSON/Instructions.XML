  "Instructions": "1. Mix flour and salt in a large bowl, gradually add water, and knead into a stiff but pliable dough.\n2. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until smooth; add oil if desired, then cover with a damp cloth and rest for 30 minutes.\n3. Optional: Sprinkle salt on cabbage, let sit for 10 minutes, and squeeze out excess water.\n4. Heat oil in a pan, sauté onion, ginger, garlic, and green chilies for 2-3 minutes until onion is translucent.\n5. Add cabbage and carrots; cook 5-7 minutes until slightly softened but still crunchy.\n6. Stir in soy sauce, pepper, and salt; cook 2-3 minutes until moisture evaporates. Cool completely and add spring onion greens + sesame oil if using.\n7. Divide rested dough into marble-sized portions and roll into thin 3-4 inch circles.\n8. Place 1 tbsp filling in the center, pleat edges, and seal tightly into desired momo shape.\n9. Lightly grease steamer basket or line with parchment/cabbage leaves. Arrange momos with space between.\n10. Steam for 10-12 minutes until translucent and firm to touch.\n11. For the sauce: Mix mayonnaise, garlic, vinegar (or lemon juice), sugar, pepper, and chili flakes in a bowl until smooth.\n12. Gradually add water or milk to adjust consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.",
  "Tips": "• Add a pinch of baking powder to the dough for extra softness.\n• Experiment with bell peppers, mushrooms, paneer, or tofu in the filling.\n• Line the steamer with parchment or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking.\n• Leftover momos can be pan-fried or deep-fried for a crispy twist.\n• The white sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days in an airtight container."
